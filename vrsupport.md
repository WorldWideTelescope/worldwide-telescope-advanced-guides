#### [Virtual Reality Support in WWT](#VRinWWT)

WorldWide Telescope is embracing Virtual Reality! WWT can now be used to put you inside a virtual universe using the Oculus Rift head mounted display. You can take an early look at what is possible!

Instructions for using Oculus in WWT are available [here](/Learn/SettingUp#Oculus) and you can download and play this this sample VR tour. You can also freely explore the universe in VR, however, we recommend [using a controller](/Learn/SettingUp#controllersandbuttons) with physical buttons and knobs, like a midi or xbox controller.

#### [Earth to Solar System Fast Forward Time and Back](#earthtoss)

This tour segment shows how to zoom out from the Earth and see a face-on view of the Solar System with planetary orbits. Then time is run forward with a time indicator and at an end time we zoom back to another location on the Earth. This segment can be used to show the passage of time probably with a timescale of one or more years.

1.  Make sure that you are in 3D Solar System mode. Also, since later on we want to illustrate the passage of time using the motion of the planets – and especially the Earth – make sure that in the Layer Manager, under Earth that “Planetary Obits” is checked.
2.  First start by setting the start time. Open view tab and enter the date and time in the Observing Time.
3.  Finding a location on the Earth where you want to start from and end at. In this example, I am starting at a hospital in Mountain View California. Note that depending on the time you selected above the location may be in darkness; if so you will have to change time such that it is in light.
4.  Set this as the beginning location of Slide 1.
5.  Zoom out using the mouse. When you are close to the ground, you probably want to limit the changes in camera to zooms and not any rotations or else the ground will move wildly when you are zooming out. In this example, I will just do a zoom out to a view of the Earth with no translation or rotation.
6.  Set this view as end location of Slide 1.
7.  Make a new slide – Slide 2.
8.  Adjust the final orientation of the Solar System such that the Earth is directly above the Sun. I use a tool called [A Ruler for Windows](http://www.arulerforwindows.com) to put a visual guide on the screen that I can use to make sure the alignment is correct as well as maintain scales. For reference I often take a screen shot of the view with the Solar System centered on the Earth before the next step. Use the ruler to measure the distance between the Earth and the Sun. You can click in the tick-mark area of the ruler and it will put a mark and numeric label at that location.
9.  Set this as the end location of Slide 2.
10.  Add new slide (Slide 3).
11.  Select (double-click) the Sun from the context menu on the bottom of the page. This will zoom into a close-up view of the Sun. Pull back out and get a face-on view of the Solar System. Align it such that the Earth is directly above the Sun and that the distance between the Earth and the Sun is what it was in the Earth-centered view.
12.  Set this as the end position of Slide 3.
13.  Add new slide (Slide 4).
14.  Add a text object and from the “Insert Field” menu – the right most menu item of the Text Editor window – select “Date.” Save the object and move it to a blank location on the screen.
15.  Click on the View tab and advance time to the desired date. This makes sense if it shows the motions of the planets, so this should be more like years than days.
16.  Set this as the end position of Slide 4.

6.  You can create new communities, sub-communities and upload files to communities from the “My Profile”. When you upload a tour, the Tour Properties are used to populate the descriptive fields on the website.  You can provide a thumbnail (wide aspect ratio of 2:1) as well.  

    Similarly, you can access communities from within the Desktop Client.

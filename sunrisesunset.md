#### [Sunrise-Sunset from Location](#sunrisesunset)

1.  Go into Earth Mode (not Solar System).
2.  Search for Earth-based location, suggest “Yosemite Valley.”
3.  Right-click on Earth in Layer Manager and select “Add Reference Frame.”
4.  Enter name for reference frame, enter “Yosemite Valley.”
5.  Take defaults but change altitude of 1,000 meters.
6.  Go into 3D Solar System mode.
7.  Target Earth by double-clicking in it in the Context Menu at the bottom.
8.  Under Earth, right click on “Yosemite Valley” and “Track this Reference Frame.”
9.  If the altitude is not correct – maybe you want to be higher to hover and look down or lower to see the view from the ground – right-click on new “Yosemite Valley” reference frame and select Properties. In the Position Tab you can make changes to the altitude, which are reflected in the view when you click “Done.”
10.  Change Observing Time under view to show daylight changes. Turn to face east and get the time to go past sunrise to see the stars go away and blue sky come out.
11.  Note that this requires atmospheric effects and lighting are enabled.
    1.  Atmospherics: In the Layer Manager under “Sun/Earth/Overlays” that “Clouds & Atmosphere” is checked.
    2.  Lighting: In the Layer Manager under “Sky/3d Solar System” that “Lighting and Shadows” is checked.

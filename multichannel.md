#### [Multi-Channel Setup](#multichannel)

WorldWide Telescope can be used to produce and deliver experiences for planetarium domes. WWT is currently being used at several planetaria, from small inflatable domes all the way to large domes, such as the 20-projector Grainger Sky Theater at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. In addition to multi-projector domes, WWT can be used to drive multiple monitor systems for flat or curved large format tiled displays. WWT has built-in support for coordinating multiple servers as well as the warps and blends necessary to create the correct projection for specific display layouts.

Instructions on how to setup and calibrate multi-channel systems can be found [here](@Model.ResLoc/Content/Planetariums/WWT%20Multi%20Channel%20Setup%20v1.5.pdf).
